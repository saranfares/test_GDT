        <h1>Your turn!</h1>
        <h2>Now that you've seen this basic HTML page and some CSS styling...</h2>
        <p>
            Feel free to visit <a href="https://github.com/Georgetown-Disruptive-Tech">our github repository</a> for some more stylized templates. <b>Credit is given on all of the templates as I did not write them myself. </b>

            &emsp;Make your own site by adding your own information into the template you choose. 
            Follow these steps:

            <li>Download the template you like from the link in the slideshow</li>

            <li>Edit the info to match your own name, resume, pictures, etc.</li>
            <li>Change the colors + styling as you wish within the stylesheet(s) (the CSS)</li>
            <li>Delete the pages that you no longer want by removing links to them + deleting the html for them</li>

            &emsp; Lastly, I suggest looking at other websites, whether they be retail, personal, or restaurant websites, and "inspecting element" on any page you like. You can find some cool HTML + CSS that these sites use and apply it to your own website. 
            <br>
            &emsp; A lot of the cool transitions and features you see on websites require scripting (which is done in a language like Javascript) or a more developed backend that interacts with an API (application program interface), databases and other structured frameworks.
