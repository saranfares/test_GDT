        <h2>To begin, what exactly is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
            <br> 
            &emsp;If HTML is an article you read, then CSS is analagous to the annotation on that article, providing highlights, notes, and underlines. 
            <br>
            &emsp;In other words, HTML provides the content like the text and images, and CSS provides the design and style. They work hand in hand but each serves a particular purpose.

        <h2>Now, a bit more on how to use it.</h2>
        <p>
            The selector is the HTML item you are referring to with the properties and values you are providing.
            <br>
            Some useful properties you might use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>color</b>- controls the text color for a given element</li>
            <li><b>background</b>- controls the background color</li>
            <li><b>display</b>- responsible for how the element shows up on the screen; some commmon values for this property are block, inline-block, and inline. Try them out and see what they do.</li>
            <li><b>text-align</b>- alignment of the text on the page</li>
        </ul>
